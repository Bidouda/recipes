    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I like to serve this chocolate strawberry shortcake on Valentine's Day. It's really good and looks nice on the table. I have had this recipe for over 40 years.</p>
    <p>It takes about an hour to prepare and servers twelve human adults.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>0.66 cups of white sugar</li>
      <li>0.25 cups of cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of baking power</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
      <li>0.5 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>0.5 cup butter</li>
      <li>1 cup of milk</li>
      <li>2 pints of sliced strawberries</li>
      <li>0.25 cups of white sugar</li>
      <li>1 container of thawed frozen whipped topping</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch layer pans.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, 1/3 cup sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add milk, mixing until just moistened. Spread batter evenly into the prepared layer pans.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, combine strawberries and remaining 1/4 cup sugar. Let mixture stand for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove shortcake layers from the pans. Place one layer on a serving plate; cover with 1/2 of the of strawberry mixture and 1/2 of the whipped topping. Place remaining shortcake layer on top, then remaining strawberry mixture and remaining whipped topping. Drizzle chocolate syrup over top.</li>
    </ol>
