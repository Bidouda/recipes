    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I make this cinnamon tea every now and then, when I pull out the German china tea set my mother-in-law brought home from one of her trips. It makes me feel special, and I can take pleasure in remembering her as I savor each sip. I like cinnamon stick tea in the afternoon, because itâ€™s warm and comforting, and there is no caffeine! Try it with a lemon slice, and a drizzle of honey, or use whatever sweetener you prefer.</p>
    <p>It takes 5 minutes to prepare, 15 minutes to cook and serves for human adults.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>700ml of water</li>
      <li>4 cinnamon sticks</li>
      <li>4 lemons</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons of honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring water and cinnamon sticks to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and allow to steep for an additional 5 minutes. Serve warm, with lemon slices and a teaspoon of honey.</li>
    </ol>
